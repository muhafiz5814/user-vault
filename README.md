## Setup and Run
- First Fork the project to include it in your repositories.
  - See how to fork [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)

- Clone the repo in your local machine.
  - Open CLI or terminal and go to the directory you want to clone the project in, and then type following command. (Replace `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>` with your own github username)
    
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/user-vault.git

- Open project in any code editor of your choice, open terminal and then install dependencies using following command:
  ```bash
    npm install
  ```

- This project uses [{JSON} Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), a free, fake and reliable API for testing and prototyping. So, there is no need to run any backend server.

- To start development server, run following command:
  ```bash
